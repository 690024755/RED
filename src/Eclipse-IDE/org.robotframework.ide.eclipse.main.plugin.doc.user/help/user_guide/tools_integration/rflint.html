	<h2>Robot Framework Lint analysis</h2>

	<p>Starting with RED 0.8.1 it is possible to run <a target="_blank" class="external" 
		href="http://github.com/boakley/robotframework-lint/">Robot Framework Lint</a> 
	analysis tool. Of course one have to have it installed in the python installation
	used by the project.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Running RfLint</h3>
	<p>RfLint can be run on selected file or folder (or whole project) in <b>Project Explorer</b> view. In order
	to start analysis open context menu for selected resource and choose <b><code>Robot Framework -&gt; Run RfLint analysis</code></b>.
	</p>

	<p>The analysis should start and its progress is visible in <b>Progress</b> view. At any time you can abort running
	validation:
	</p>
	<img src="images/rflint_progress.png"/>
	
	<p>Analysis performed from RED is reporting all the findings as <b>Problem markers</b> of a separate type called
	<b>RfLint Problem</b>. This is a different type than those reported by standard RED <a href="../validation.html">
	validation</a> mechanism (they have <b>Robot Problem</b> type). Overall this means that the findings are visible
	in <b>Problems</b> view and are also visible in editors. 
	</p>
	<img src="images/rflint_problems.png"/>
	
	<p>In order to remove problems simply choose <b><code>Robot Framework -&gt; Clean RfLint problems</code></b> from context menu
	of selected resource.
	</p>
	
	<dl class="note">
	   <dt>Note</dt>
	   <dd>Robot Framework Lint analysis is not run on excluded project parts (see more under topic <a href="../validation/scope.html">Limiting validation scope</a>.
	   </dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Configuration</h3>
	
	<p>It is possible to configure RfLint behavior in Preferences (
		<code><a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.rflint)')">
		Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Robot Framework -&gt; Errors/Warnings -&gt; RfLint validation</a></code>).
	</p>
	
	<h4>General tab</h4>
	<p>On <b>General</b> tab it is possible to define:
	</p>
	<ul>
        <li><b>additional rules files</b> - those files will be attached with all the rules when running RfLint analysis.
        Those rules can be further configured at <b>Rules</b> tab,
        <p/>
        </li>
        <li><b>additional arguments</b> - custom RfLint arguments that will be used for analysis. See RfLint user guide
        for more details on possible arguments.
        <p/>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <dl class="note">
       <dt>Note</dt>       
       <dd>Additional arguments field accepts Eclipse <a href="../launching/string_substitution.html">string variables</a>.</dd>
    </dl>

	<h4>Rules tab</h4>
	<p>On <b>Rules</b> tab it is possible to configure rule severity as well as additional rule parameters.
	
	<ul>
		<li>rule <b>severity</b> - rule of a given name can have severity specified: <b>Error</b> and <b>Warning</b> 
		changes severity to one of those levels, while <b>Ignore</b> will silence the rule (Ignore can be set also by check-box),
		<p/>
		</li>
		<li>rule <b>configuration</b> - as described in <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://github.com/boakley/robotframework-lint/wiki/How-to-write-custom-rules">RfLint Wiki</a>
		some rules can be parameterized: simply write arguments for given rule and remember that multiple arguments
		should be separated with colon (:) character.
		<p/>
		</li>
	</ul>
    <dl class="note">
       <dt>Note</dt>       
       <dd>RED will only store changes to default rule configurations. The changed rule is marked with bold
       font. It is possible that RED is storing configuration of a rule which is currently not recognised
       by your RfLint installation and such rule is marked red.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Displaying rules documentation</h3>
    
    <p>It is possible to see the rule documentation straight from <b>Problems</b> view by using context menu
    action on given RfLint problem. The documentation will be displayed in <b>Documentation</b> view.
