<h2>Recognizing external libraries in RED</h2>

	<p>In order to provide validation and keyword assistance of external libraries (any library not bundled with 
	RobotFramework but installed by pip or included in your test material) they <b>need</b> to be 
	included in <b>red.xml</b> file in the Referenced libraries part. Additionally one may define arguments if
	they are required by the library.
	</p>
    
	
<h3>Including libraries into red.xml</h3>
	
	<p>There are few ways to include library into red.xml.</p>

<h4>Library autodiscovery</h4>

	<p>Main way to include libraries keywords in RED is done by autodiscovery mechanism. Mechanism works on two 
	levels - during test edition and executed in Project Explorer on group of files and folders.
	</p>
	
	<p>Every time when user edits test suite which has error markers on library declaration autodiscovery is executed 
	when file is saved.
	</p>
	
	<p>When there is a need to run autodiscovery manually on list of files, folders or whole project it can be 
	achieved by using context menu in Project Explorer from Robot Framework option.</p>

	<dl class="note">
	   <dt>Note</dt>
	   <dd>Library autodiscovering is not run on excluded project parts (see more under topic 
	   <a href="../validation/scope.html">Limiting validation scope</a>).
	   </dd>
	</dl>

<h4>Quick Fix - shortcut CTRL+1</h4>

	<p>Lets focus on following example:</p>
	<img src="images/unknown_libs.png">
	
	<p>In the sample above there are two libraries imported. <code>CalculatorLibrary.py</code> is a custom user local 
	library placed in the same folder as suite file while <code>Selenium2Library</code> was installed by
	<code>pip</code>.
	</p>
	
    <p>Both libraries are not recognized by RED and validation places error markers on libraries name/path.    
	Note the light bulb in error marker - it indicates that there is Quick Fix action available.  
	</p>
	
	<p>Click on the library name in test editor, open right click menu and choose Quick Fix or use CTRL+1 shortcut:
	</p>
	
	<img src="images/autodiscovery_quick_fix.png">
	
	<p>After selecting <b>Discover</b> option RED will search either <code>PYTHONPATH</code> or library file path.
	If successful the library will be added to Referenced libraries section in red.xml
	</p>

<h4>Add library from Project Explorer</h4>

	<p>External Python libraries can be directly included to red.xml file by right clicking on file and using option:
	<code>Robot Framework -&gt; Add Library to red.xml.</code>
	</p>


<h4>Add library from red.xml editor</h4>
	<p>External library can be also added directly from red.xml editor:
	</p>

<h4>Using libdoc file when external library is not present locally</h4>

	<p>In some scenarios, testware edit happens on different host than test runtime thus it is undesirable/unnecessary to 
	install/import all libraries as on remote host. RobotFramework provides possibility to generate an xml file with list 
	of keywords, this also provides agile test development where libraries are developed in parallel to test cases.
	Libdoc xml file can be included instead of external library file by using red.xml editor.
	</p>
	
	<p>For more information about LibDoc please refer to <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://robot-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/robot/libdoc.html?highlight=libdoc">

	</p>

    
<h3>Dynamic vs static library and library arguments</h3>

    <p>From RED point of view there are two types of libraries: <b>static</b> and <b>dynamic</b>. The first one is a
    library for which the specification does not depend upon parameters provided when importing it, while the latter
    depends upon them. For example standard <code>Remote</code> library is a <b>dynamic</b> library because depending
    what <code>uri</code> value will be provided when importing it the specification may be different (because 
    <code>Remote</code> may provided different keywords depending to which machine it will connect). All the other
    standard libraries included into Robot are <b>static</b> libraries - for example no matter what parameters 
    will be provided when importing <code>Telnet</code> libraries the keywords will always be the same.   
    </p>
    
    <p>By default library entry in <b>red.xml</b> is marked as static. It is possible to change it manually in the
    editor.</p> 
    <p>For library marked as static RED will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>only allow to add maximum one possible arguments list in <b>red.xml</b> (because no more is needed as 
        specification is always the same independently on argument values),</li>
        <li>not consider what are the values of arguments passed, when the library is imported in some suite.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For library marked as dynamic RED will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>allow to define multiple arguments list in <b>red.xml</b> and will generate specification file for each
        provided arguments list,
        </li>    
        <li>look for specification by comparing used arguments with those defined in red.xml, when the library
        is imported in some suite.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The diagram below presents the example for better overview:
    </p>
    
    <img src="images/libs_static_dynamic_diagram.png"/>
    
    <p>The library <code>dynamic</code> uses Robot <a href="http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#different-test-library-apis" class="external" target="_blank">
    dynamic API</a> and provides different number of keywords printing different things depending on the value of 
    <code>a</code> argument in <code>__init__</code> constructor. The <code>static</code> library however is a simple
    library which may accept single argument and provides always a single keyword independently on value passed when
    importing. Both libraries are added to <b>red.xml</b> - the first is marked as dynamic while the latter is not.
    RED makes it possible to define two different values lists for constructor of <code>dynamic</code> library and
    generates two specifications with both lists which is visible in <b>Robot Referenced libraries</b> folder in 
    Project explorer.
    </p>
    
    <p>Finally when importing <code>static</code> library RED does not analyze arguments provided so it successfully
    recognizes this import. However when importing <code>dynamic</code> library it will not recognize the import called
    with <b>4</b> because it is only aware of specifications generated with <b>[3]</b> and <b>[5]</b>.
    </p>
    
<h4>Standard Remote library</h4>

<p>Standard <code>Remote</code> library is a <b>dynamic</b> library for which one need to define possible arguments. 
This is done similarly as for external libraries by providing different (possibly multiple) locations which will be used
when generating library specification and recognizing imports in tests suites.

<h3>Library autodiscovering and libdoc generation preferences</h3>

    <p>Autodiscovering and libdoc generation preferences can be configured at <code><a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.libraries)')">
Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Robot Framework -&gt; Libraries</a></code></p>

	<img src="images/libraries_preferences.png">

    <dl class="warning">
       <dt>Warning</dt>
       <dd>If the libraries you are going to debug use <code>Gevent</code> library then please select <b>Support Gevent 
       during autodiscovery</b> checkbox. This will make it possible for autodiscovery mechanism to support such libraries. 
       Without this you may experience hanging both when looking for libraries as well as when keyword source
       is being searched.
       </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <dl class="note">
       <dt>Note</dt>
       <dd>In some cases problems occur during libdoc generation via session server. It leads to a situation when the 
       server hangs due to 
       <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>
       between the server code and the library code.<br> 
       To avoid this problem since version 0.8.11 libdocs are generated in a separate process by default. Note that this solution
       may affect the time of libdoc generation, i.e. slowing down the libraries import, especially with jython interpreter.
       If you are not using problematic libraries you can disable the preference to make libdoc generation faster.
       </dd>
    </dl>

<h3>Reloading libraries after change</h3>

	<p>Whenever external library is changed (for instance new keyword is added) libdoc needs to be regenerated to 
	provide changes on content assist and validation in RED. Since version 0.6.3 RED can automatically detect 
	library change and regenerate libdoc (it can be switch off/on in 
	<a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.libraries)')">
	preferences</a>). This can be also done manually by right clicking on library in Project Explorer and selecting
	<i>Reload action</i>.
	</p>
	
	<p>Manual library reloading can be also useful for finding libdoc generation errors. Whenever RED encounters 
	libdoc generation problem, it will be shown as popup window from Python execution:</p>
	
	<img src="images/libdoc_error.png">
	
	<p>This indicates that some of the dependencies are missing on your local machine which may affect test 
	suites execution. To verify you can try to execute libdoc in console:
	</p>
	
	<pre>
    	<code>python -m robot.libdoc &lt;PATH_TO_LIBNAME&gt; list</code>
	</pre>
