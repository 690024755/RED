<h2>Global variable files</h2>

	<p>Robot Framework allows to use Python variable files in test suites in two distinctive ways. <b>Direct usage</b>
	is done by importing the file in <b>Settings</b> section of a suite file as follows:
	</p>
	
	<pre>
    <code>
    <span class="syntax_section">*** Settings ***</span>
    <span class="syntax_setting">Variables</span>    &lt;path_to_python_var_file.py&gt;</code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>which allows to make the variables from given file accessible across tests suite.</p>
    
	<p><b>Global usage</b> is a way to use common variable file across any tests suite. In RED this can be achieved 
	by including variables files in <b>red.xml</b> file under Variable Files tab. Once this is done RED will recognize
	those variables in any suite which would use them. From Robot perspective this is equivalent to providing the file
	with <code>-V</code> switch in command line.
	</p>

<h3>Python variable files to deal with missing variables</h3>

	<p>In some test environments Robot-specific environments variables are used in test cases or injected as arguments
	to Robot test runner. RED is not aware of such usage thus those variables will be marked as unknown and error marker
	will be placed. In order to include variable name validation without changing test suites, user can create local
	Python file with list of variable names inside. Such file can be included in <b>red.xml</b> file under Variable
	files section thus making RED aware of previously unknown variables. Variables from such file will be visible 
	as Global variables for all Robot files inside Project.
	</p>
	
	<dl class="note">
	    <dt>Note</dt>
	    <dd>Variables provided via <b>red.xml</b> are used by RED only for validation purpose and are not added to Robot 
	    run command line when executing tests. During test execution variables have to be provided differently.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>Below is a sample body of such Python variable file (examples can be also found in RobotFramework official manual 
	and Python examples).</p>
	 
    <pre>
	<code>
	#!python

	#Sample variables and values
	Scalar = 'value'
	UserList = ['value1','value2']
	UserDict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
	</code>
    </pre>

<h3>Reloading variable file content</h3>

    <p>Once the variables file imported into <b>red.xml</b> is changed RED will automatically invoke refresh of variable
    files being changed so that the modifications are immediately visible. Alternatively this can be done manually 
    by opening context menu on project and selecting <code>Robot Framework -&gt; Reset Robot Environment</code>
